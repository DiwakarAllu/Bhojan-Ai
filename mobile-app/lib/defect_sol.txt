## üêõ Issue: `UnmodifiableUint8ListView` Not Defined in `CroppedFile`

### **Problem Summary**

When running a Flutter project using the `image_cropper` package (v4.0.0 or v5.0.0) on **Chrome (Web)**, the following error occurs:

```
Error: The method 'UnmodifiableUint8ListView' isn't defined for the class 'CroppedFile'
```

This happens in the file:

```
.../image_cropper_platform_interface/lib/src/models/cropped_file/html.dart
```

### **Root Cause**

The class `CroppedFile` attempts to wrap byte data with `UnmodifiableUint8ListView`, a constructor introduced in **Dart 3.2** as part of the `dart:typed_data` library.

Even though Dart 3.6.1 is being used, **the web build environment sometimes fails to resolve or recognize this constructor**, especially during incremental builds or when a cached package version is compiled with mismatched Flutter tooling.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Patch the Package Code

### **Step 1: Open the File**

Edit:

```
<flutter_pub_cache>/image_cropper_platform_interface-x.x.x/lib/src/models/cropped_file/html.dart
```

### **Step 2: Modify `_bytes` Getter**

Replace:

```dart
return Future<Uint8List>.value(UnmodifiableUint8ListView(_initBytes!));
```

with:

```dart
return Future<Uint8List>.value(Uint8List.fromList(_initBytes!));
```

> This change avoids immutability but ensures compatibility with all platforms.

## üîß Optional: Make the Patch Permanent

To avoid reapplying this fix after `flutter pub get`:

1. Copy the package to your project:

   ```
   your_project/packages/image_cropper_platform_interface/
   ```

2. Point to it in `pubspec.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   dependency_overrides:
     image_cropper_platform_interface:
       path: packages/image_cropper_platform_interface
   ```

---

## üìù Notes

* `UnmodifiableUint8ListView` is a Dart 3.2+ feature. If strict immutability is needed, use runtime checks or fallback wrappers.
* This issue may be resolved in future versions of `image_cropper` or Flutter‚Äôs web toolchain.
